I completed this project along with a few of my peers as a final project for our computer methodology class.
It was assigned to demonstrate an agile development framework. There were frequent progress reports, and there was another group that acted as our "clients".
Our clients wanted a school system that would enable teachers to assign homeworks, and enable students to submit homeworks. It makes use of a "class" object that is shared between students and teachers.

I learned a lot about working in a team during the course of this project. Not always do schedules or coding styles coincide, but good self-documenting code with small explanations go a long way in helping a team work together asynchronously.
I look forward to using this skill of teamwork to work in a real software development environment.
